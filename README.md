#Neural Networks Demystified

Supporting iPython notebooks for the YouTube Series Neural Networks Demystified. I've included formulas, code, and the text of the movies in the iPython notebooks, in addition to raw code in python scripts. 

iPython notebooks can be downloaded and run locally, or viewed using nbviewer: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/.
